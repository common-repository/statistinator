Your Social Media Analytics in one place.

== Description ==
Why open 4 different browser tabs to view your current Social Media Statistics?

Statistinator allows you to view your:

*   Website Views (Google Analytics)
*   Facebook Page likes
*   Twitter Followers
*   Mailchimp Subscribers
*   YouTube Subscribers

all in one convenient place.

Statistinator stores this data so you can view your website's progress in the past 30 days.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

After that follow these instructions to set it up:

1. Go to Settings > Statistinator
1. Click on the "Authentication" tab
1. Authenticate with the social networks you want to get data from. 
1. After that, visit the "Accounts" tab and enter your Social Media Accounts information.
1. Done! Now you can see your data on your settings page, and in your WordPress Dashboard.

Data is gathered daily so you will have to wait a few days for the graph to take form.
